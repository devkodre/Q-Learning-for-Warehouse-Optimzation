In this study, the focus is to leverage RL techniques for warehouse optimization, departing from traditional static methods. Unlike datasets or linear programming, RL offers a versatile approach allowing warehouses to adapt and optimize in real time. By learning from interactions with the environment, RL algorithms can tailor decisions to specific warehouse criteria, such as minimizing travel time throughout the warehouse, maximizing space utilization, and prioritizing package handling. This flexibility is desirable in warehouses where the layout, inventory, and workflows can vary significantly over time.

In our approach, we utilized the Unity game engine as a visualization and testing platform for the reinforcement learning models. Unity provided an interactive 3D environment to simulate the warehouse layout and package handling scenarios. While the core RL algorithms were implemented in Python, the trained Q-tables were exported and integrated into the Unity framework. This allowed us to visualize the learned policies, evaluate the warehouse configurations, and validate the RL models' performance in a realistic simulation environment. 

Our Q-learning implementation involved fine-tuning parameters such as learning rates, discount factors, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs to optimize the performance of the agents. To balance exploration and exploitation, we employed an epsilon-greedy policy within the Python environment, where actions were chosen based on a predefined exploration probability epsilon (Îµ = 0.1). This approach allowed us to ensure both effective exploration of the state space and exploitation of learned knowledge.

In Unity, the exported Q-table was visualized to provide feedback on the learned policies and warehouse configurations. While Python handled the training and optimization of the Q-learning agents, Unity served as a platform for interactive visualization and validation of the RL models. This collaborative approach facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the warehouse optimization process while leveraging Unity for data interpretation.
