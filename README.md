In this study, the focus is to leverage RL techniques for warehouse optimization, departing from traditional static methods. Unlike datasets or linear programming, RL offers a versatile approach allowing warehouses to adapt and optimize in real time. By learning from interactions with the environment, RL algorithms can tailor decisions to specific warehouse criteria, such as minimizing travel time throughout the warehouse, maximizing space utilization, and prioritizing package handling. This flexibility is desirable in warehouses where the layout, inventory, and workflows can vary significantly over time.
